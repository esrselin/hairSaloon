# hairSaloon

The hair salon website has been created using Laravel 9, PHP, HTML5, and the XAMPP Control Panel (which includes MySQL and Apache). On this site, appointments can be made, service prices reviewed, and business details accessed by users. Within the admin panel, invoices are displayed, and management of customer and service data is enabled - allowing creation, updates, and deletions. Search functionality permits queries based on names or appointment numbers, while appointment information remains editable. Past appointments and invoices are accessible via appointment numbers or names. Additionally, administrators can be created by existing admins. For each role, user credentials are stored comprising a username (email) and a securely hashed password utilizing the Secure Hashing Algorithm (SHA).
